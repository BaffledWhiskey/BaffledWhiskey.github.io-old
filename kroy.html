        Assessment 1 covers the early stages of requirements speciﬁcation and design – including the architecture of our proposed 
		solution; method selection, planning; and risk assessment and mitigation. As part of the assessment, we identified 
		appropriate software engineering methods and techniques, set up a regular meeting schedule, and allocated
		tasks to team members according to team member availability and skills.

		Assessment 2 concerns the detailed software engineering design, and implementation of part of the software system, 
		based on the requirements and speciﬁcation created for Assessment 1. We will revisit the Assessment 1 deliverables, 
		review and maintain non-code deliverables, and apply version control.<br><br>

		Our group’s scenario (product brief) indicates which elements are to be designed and implemented for Assessment 2. 
		In Assessment 2, you must not exceed this brief: do not implement any other features.<br><br>

		Our product must be consistent with the scenario, and with our Assessment 1 work, as described below.

        Assessment 3 requires each team to work on another team’s product. There are thus two phases to the assessment, below. 
		As in the previous assessment, Assessment 3 requires review, maintenance and version control activities.<br><br>

		<b><u>Phase 1: selection</u></b><br><br>

		After the submission of Assessment 2, each team has a short period to consider the products of the other teams. In the 
		Spring Week 3 practical class that your team attends, each team will present its product, and can then discuss with other 
		teams. On Spr/4/Monday, each team is required to register, by 10am, their choice of product to work on in Assessment 3, by 
		emailing the lecturers.<br><br>

		The only constraint on selection is that a team is not allowed to use its own Assessment 2 software in Assessment 3.<br><br>

		In selecting a software product, criteria that may be considered include: (1) the overall quality of the software product; (2) 
		estimates of effort remaining to complete the implementation; (3) clarity and quality of the requirements speciﬁcation, 
		architecture, testing and implementation.<br><br>

		A bonus of 2 marks will be added to the team’s Assessment 2 mark for each registered selection of the team’s software product, 
		with the condition that no individual can attain more than 100% for Assessment 2.<br><br>

		<b><u>Phase 2: extension and integration</u></b><br><br>

		Your selected product should have designed and implemented the initial elements of the game, as indicated in your group’s scenario. 
		For Assessment 3, the selected software product must be extended to cover the full product brief.<br><br>

		For this assessment, you are allowed, but not required, to add other features or behaviours, as desired, but these must be fully 
		explained and justiﬁed in the deliverables, and must not violate the requirements for the game.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-parent="#accordionInfo">
      <div class="card-body">
        Assessment 4 requires you to work on a product other than that which the team worked on in Assessment 3. 
		After product selection, changes will be issued. There are thus two preliminary phases before the main phase of 
		Assessment 4. For Assessment 4, there is also an assessed presentation which will take place in Summer week 4.<br><br>

		<b><u>Phase 1: selection</u></b><br><br>

		After the submission of Assessment 3. each team has a short period to consider the products of the other teams. 
		In the <b>Spring Week 7 practical</b> class that your team attends, each team will present its product, and can then 
		discuss with other teams. On Spr/8/Mon, each team is required to register, by 10am, their choice of product to 
		work on in Assessment 4, by <b>emailing the lecturers</b>.<br><br>

		The only constraint on selection is that a team is not allowed to use its own Assessment 3 software for Assessment 4. 
		A team is allowed to use another team’s Assessment 3 extension of its original Assessment 2 product, but must work from 
		the Assessment 3 version.<br><br>

		In selecting a software product, criteria that may be considered include: (1) the overall quality of the software product; 
		(2) estimates of effort remaining to make the required changes to the implementation; (3) clarity and quality of the requirements 
		speciﬁcation, architecture, testing and implementation.<br><br>

		A bonus of 2 marks will be added to the team’s Assessment 3 mark for each registered selection of the team’s software product 
		for Assessment 4, with the condition that no individual can attain more than 100% for Assessment 3.<br><br>

		<b><u>Phase 2: requirements change</u></b><br><br>

		For each group, a small set of changes will be issued on Spr/8/Mon (after all teams have registered their choice of product); 
		these may include changes to the scenario and/or introduction of new requirements.<br><br>

		Using your selected software product, the team must modify the software product and supporting documentation to address these 
		changes. Teams must also produce an up-to-date website for the game.<br><br>


		<b><u>Assessment 4: Assessed Presentation [20 marks]</u></b><br><br>

		Each team is required to make a presentation of the ﬁnished game as if to an external client. The client, who will be an 
		experienced software engineer or games developer, will question the teams about their games and may ask to see the accompanying 
		marketing and technical information on the website.<br><br>

		The presentation should assume that the client is interested in buying or marketing the product, and is thus aware of the 
		requirements speciﬁed for the product (including the changes in Assessment 4). Whilst the client will be interested, in 
		general, in major design decisions, the quality of the software, and the playability of the game, s/he is likely to be also 
		interested in the potential market for, and extensibility of, the product.<br><br>

		The presentation will take place in a meeting room with access to the University computer network: within this constraint, 
		teams can use any appropriate media, and any combination of team members may take part. The presentation should take at most 
		<b>5 minutes</b>.<br><br>

		Each team will be marked on the clarity and appropriateness of its presentation and its interaction with the client. Marking is 
		independent of the client’s award (the prize!) for what s/he considers the best product.
